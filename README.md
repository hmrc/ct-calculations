CT Calculations is a library that contains the domain needed to create a Corporations Tax return for HMRC. This includes implementations of Boxes and calculations required to produce a CT600, including CT600J, CT600A and Computations. 

At the moment this library supports a subset of Boxes and calculations but we are open to supporting the full set of available boxes.
